 to be referred to the finance committee. It will be referred to the finance committee. Now on the two files on the veto message, the law requires that there be publication for X number of days, how many days that is? They have been published as of today for five days. I mean but they have to be published five days prior to action. They were published as of today so we won't be able to act upon them theoretically until the next meeting of the council. I do not feel that it's necessary to send these out to committee. I think we'll just hold them in the council here and act upon them next meeting if that meets what you'll come and consent. Mr. Ravel. Yes, Mr. President, in the case of the city light rate increase, as I understand it, the veto is supposed to be followed by some additional proposal, the outlines of which I know nothing about. And it seems to me, at least in the case of that one, it would be appropriate to have it before an appropriate committee so we can, you know, address whatever additional proposal there is unless you want to do it in a committee of the whole format as part of next Monday's meeting, which would be another way of doing it. With respect to the landmarks thing, I want to take a look at the concerns that were raised, but I don't care whether that's done as part of the planning committee or back before the whole council. It's really the city light one that, as I understand it, Mr. Miller and Mr. Larkin may know more than I is going to have some committee type work in looking at an alternative proposal and we need some forum to address that. Now it might be that next Monday committee of the whole is the way to do it. Mr. Revell, the reason why I didn't suggest it go to committee because we either have to accept or reject the veto and we may not amend the bill or change it in its scope or form in a way whatsoever. Even if there was another proposal, it would have to be considered separately and I doubt seriously whether after we've taken three or four months to work the city like the whole, I doubt seriously whether we could act upon a new proposal without going through the hearings and so forth that would require some time. So in my book we will have to more or less accept the reject the vetoes and then whatever else corrective action that we may want to consider we may do so. If the veto is not- No we cannot amend. If the veto is- Is that Sam Smith's rules or is that the charge? This is regular rules. This is true in all vetoes in all legislative bodies. Now if we were going to- excuse me cut my train of thought. We were going to go through the other matters even in the landmarks ordinance still the same would be that we'd have to go through another process. So the question is whether you're going to accept the rejected and that'll come up next week. Yes Mr. Lamphere. What is a time frame within which we have to act? I believe it's within 20 days however with city like thing it's more pressing than that. They have the machinery set for the rate increase and it must be active form because it goes into effect as of April. 20 days from the time that we receive it. 20 days from the time that we do it but we may not act before it's been published for five days at least. Okay. But you may not mend it. You cannot change it in any way shape or form. You can either accept or reject it. That's what you have to do. Yes but at this point we I would think we would take all the time we need to make that decision because the information coming to us will affect that decision and so I would- Which decision are you talking about? Whether to accept or reject. I do not think we have to rush to accept or reject the mayor's veto next Monday. Well it'll be before you can decide to put it off five votes is policy you can decide to do whatever you feel like you want to do so long as you don't take more than the 20 days. 30. Whatever it is 30 days. So long as you don't take more than that length of time but it will it won't even be before us until that time. Until what time? Monday. Okay well I think when I- And you don't have the other proposal yet? No. No we don't and we so what you're saying is next Monday we may decide to take it up and we may decide to put it over. We cannot make that decision now. Five votes can decide most anything in this council. Okay we do not make that decision now or we could make that decision now? Well we theoretically could but I think that we're not eligible to have it up before us for action now. Okay okay so the first time it's before us for action is next Monday. Okay. Same is true with the landmark ordinance and Mr. Crowell had his microphone up. Just with regard to the landmark ordinance all put together a memo that addresses the substance the veto message. It'll be a short memo. Yes all right. Anyhow that sound that we heard cracking was the last of Mr. Crowell's hair coming out when the mayor vetoed it. What's left of it? I notice another inch went over the water. That's not bad. Stick around kid. There's a sure right. Now if you wish to if you wish to take it to committee you're welcome but I think it's one of those things where you got to do one of the other. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Resolution. We're not on the resolution. Are we on that? No not yet. Not yet. All right let the record show that Mrs. Lamphere has joined us and that Mr. Tim Hill is excused for 15 minutes so he can give a pint of blood and he'll be back bloodless. Move and seconded that the communication file be approved as amended. All those in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed no. The motion carried. Now council bill you have any changes for the council bill Mr. Crowell. Well a couple here. One is the first resolution. Is this time for resolutions or? Council bill include resolution. Okay resolution 225474 is listed here as being referred to committee of the whole. It's in for adoption today. This is your resolution that you would like to have adopted today. With regard to the block grant submission. We will change that from committee of the whole to introduction and adoption. We'll take it up at the time that resolutions come up. Okay this would be the time for suspend the rules for purposes of introducing council bill 898294 for referral to planning and urban development. Okay Mr. Crowell has moved and I'll second it that council bill 98294 be introduced and referred to the planning committee. Yes. All those in favor say aye. Opposed no. The motion is carried. Any further. Mr. Crowell it's an ordinance authorizing an agreement with Seattle Chinatown International District Preservation and Development Authority to provide financial assistance for purchase of Bush hotel and etc. etc. That was what I was getting up for. Mr. Crowell. Yes Mr. President it was my understanding from our executive director that Mr. Crowell had another resolution on the policy planning agenda that you were supposed to introduce. Yes is that? More than that I'm just getting warmed up. Oh okay. You mean you've been talking with the executive director today I thought he was home in bed. Well he has a phone next to him. He calls up periodically and worries. We have a resolution here I do not have a number for it relating to the schedule. Describing the city of Seattle's policy planning process, establishing the policy planning agenda for 77-78, describing the issues, work products. Yes. Mr. Crowell. Aye. Williams. Aye. Mr. President.

I wanted to take a peek at it. I don't know. We'll see if he finds the changes. Any further business to come before City Council? Mr. Chair. Mr. Hill. Mr. Chairman, I discussed with you briefly this morning a matter that's come to the Council. The Mayor has proposed some bond issues for this fall. And there was a process that OPP and other departments went through. We voted in this morning and referred to Finance Committee. Okay, it has been referred to Finance Committee. The Finance Committee will review this matter on Thursday. And then we'll take the first presentation by OPP and begin discussing it. The reason we have to move quickly is because the Mayor's office is assuming that the three projects that police precincts, the remodeling of the Public Safety Building, and the Seattle Center Bond issue. A variation of that. That's the new Public Safety Building, not the old Public Safety Building. Not both old, but the newer one. And there was a process, which I think was a very good one, that the OPP went through in looking at all the possible bond issue kinds of projects. And it may be that after you look at them, you may want to put more on or delete some. But this is a process that we should make our input now so that the detailed work that will be undertaken in the next couple of weeks or a month can concentrate on the projects we're interested in. So it will be on Thursday, 9 o'clock. Did I see another hand? Yes, Mr. President, you have Resolution number 25474, which was laid over until the end of the calendar, on a community development block grant for fiscal year 1977. Mr. Deville and Mr. He was supposed to check something out. He was supposed to check the problem. I'd like to suggest the following amendment. In the first paragraph, at the very first page, you know, A Resolution authorizing blah, blah, blah, scratch fiscal and insert program. In the next paragraph, the first whereas. Just a minute. Go to scratch fiscal and put program. Program year. Any objection to that change? First page, just at the very top. All right. Okay, and just one other. In the first whereas, it talks about FY 1977. Make it PY 1977. FY 1977, we want to change that to PY right after the $9 million. 9,400,000 in PY 1977. Any objection to that? No objection, I'll put it in. Further? On the last page, you do not wish to make a change on that in 1977 anyway, is all right? Well, it doesn't say there. Okay, just wanted to make sure. All right, now, Mr. Vail. There's one other I just noticed. It talks about an attachment A, and at least in the one I got, there isn't any. That is the booklet. The 1977 Community Development Block Grant Program booklet. No? Now I'm being told it's a list of? Okay. Yeah, I got the resolution, but I didn't get any copy of the list. 1977 Block Grant Entitled here? Oh, yeah, it's perfect. I'm sorry. I don't know what's happening here. Okay, now, this is, I'm sorry, but I'm really confused. You know, it's a little hard to deal with the thing when I got it this morning. Yeah. I didn't get the attachment that lists now I see some 40-some-odd budget items. Now, are these the approval of what's being spent this year now that we've already acted on, or is this now approval of these budget items for fiscal 78 money? This would be, it's my understanding that the Excuse me. Let me suspend the rule here so that we might have some input from the floor there from Mr. Walty. What's the name? Prowley. Prowley. If you so desire. Go ahead, Ms. Prowley. Well, that's fine. My understanding is that the money is available July 1st, and would be available to be spent on these projects as of July 1st of this year. Is that now being allocated in September? The only thing to be allocated in September, there's going to be money available, you'll see just below halfway down the page in attachment A, two things of rather indefinite scope, housing rehabilitation projects, parentheses, to be programmed in CIP, and physical development improvements to be programmed in CIP. The money for, quote, housing rehabilitation projects will be available the 1st of July. We will not have defined specific projects, however, until we go through the CIP process. And so that portion will slip until September or so. But the money will be here and in the bank, so to speak, or available for whatever it is we decide in the housing rehabilitation area, or in the physical development improvements area. Okay, so let me just make sure I understand. This is, in effect, the recommended budget for money that will be coming in under the fiscal year 78 entitlement. That's the time period, yes. No, I mean the federal. It's a federal fiscal year 78 entitlement. No, the money is in the federal. Mr. Crawley, would you come to the right? Yeah, I can't tell you whether the money is coming out of what fiscal year, but the projects take place in fiscal year 78, but that's misleading, I think, to say it that way. Mr. Crawley, would you like to mislead us further? I'll certainly attempt. It's funds that have already been allocated by Congress, and it's coming out of the federal fiscal 77 budget. It's just coming to us late because we're operating at a different rate than Congress is. Okay. In terms of what we've been doing, these are third-year funding projects, though. Correct. So this is the third time. This is the third program year. So what you've done basically, Mr. Croble, is continue those projects that have demonstrated success and so forth, and then that leaves some certain amount of discretionary money left over, and that's for programming at a later time. Is that in effect what this reflects? Yes. Were these reviewed by the committee as to whether the continuation was appropriate and so forth? Mr. Crawley? Yes, we did have the policy meetings that we've been having the last two, three, four days, last week. This was considered during that time when we were trying very hard to get people to come in and help us. You'll notice north Greenwood Street improvements, a half million, 5-8. We've already committed that. In previous Block Grant Committee of the Whole meetings, I mean like a year ago when we went through it. Southeast community development, that's the amount of money we said we were going to give them in third year. Neighborhood program, we committed to that last year also, and we said do your planning and each neighborhood gets, I think it's $200,000 to implement. Pike Place. Pike Place, we're quite committed on that if we want to get the urgent needs money. International district improvement, we also committed a year ago. Two have been added, I'd forgotten about these, and they are relatively small. Minor home repair for the elderly, $45,000, and environmental works, $11,000. I'd just say that those are smallish physical improvement programs that are ongoing. We almost certainly want to continue. If we put them in the other category, there would be a lapse, there would be a period of three months or so where they had no money, and then we'd refund them and pump their funding back up, and they'd have to go out and try to get the people back. So we decided to go with those two after getting an explanation from OPP. Then we have the two general categories, which we're going to decide on later, and then we have the public service projects, which are all projects which we've had in year two, if not year one and two. Yeah, that was what I was going to ask. Are there any projects under the public service ones, health programs, elderly programs, childcare, intervention, recreation, community services that are new, that haven't either been funded? No, I think there's nothing. The one I had never heard of was Cascade. We funded Cascade for something in one or two of those years. Yeah, we did it in health. Okay. So all of these are ones that have been funded for something either in the first and or the second year. That's correct. They all were in the second year and some perhaps in the first. And as I understand it, there are no discretionary funds left from the community services project. That's correct. We've hewed to the 20 percent line, which I believe is pushing the feds just a little in that area anyway. Well, in effect, the standing level is lower. And we got reduced by about a million dollars in the top. It's 20 percent of a smaller number. Yeah, so as I understand it, for this year it's on the way down. One unresolved issue is when we get to May or so, we're going to have all the money that they're spending on administration, which is a sizable chunk of this, and we can ask some piercing questions on why they need all that much money for administration, why is the administration the same figure when the rest of the program has gone down. So maybe there's a little bit, there's some work to be done there. But we have a shot at that later. Okay, thank you. Mrs. Lamphere. I think the handle you put on the year is still confusing. I find the attachment perfectly clear, 77 block grant entitlement. That clearly says what it is. Program year 1977 doesn't really help me much. Because it raises as many questions as it answers. But if you say 77 entitlement, it's clear that it's the third year of the federal budget or allocation on this. And whenever we spend it is whenever we get it, and it's according to this plan. So I wondered where the program year 77 reference. I don't mind staying with fiscal year, I just had a question. Yeah, I just think we ought to stick with the handles, we understand. Well, as to the source of the program year, that's the designation we've used since the program began. The only reason we've been calling it program year, and the reason it gets confused with the old fiscal year, is the fact that it's a July 1 to June 30 year as opposed to a calendar year. The 1977 program year will begin July 1 of this year and run until June 30 of 1978. Yeah, but there's still 77 entitlement funds. Federal 77. Yeah. Our spending takes place from July to July in the 77 program year. Yeah, I'm well aware of that, but. We called it 76 program year last year, we called it 75 program year, I think. 75, 76, 77. If you read the whole thing. We don't think the federal officials who give us the money are going to get their father, do we? Not then, I don't think we'd worry too much about it, as long as we get the money. Mr. Chairman. That's a practical. Mr. Hill. I'm now a member of the Planning and Urban Development Committee, and I must say that it has been a confusing time, because we're trying to combine the policy plan. CIP. And the CIP, and we've got growth policies, and I think Mr. Crowell has done a very good job in getting it all lined out and presented to the committee with all the issues, and it's really a relatively simple, this is a relatively simple document, because I believe we've already gone on record saying that since the money's going down, we're simply keeping on those programs that seem to work. Some programs are getting cut out, and other than the Southeast Seattle portion, all the rest of these things are quite straightforward. We've already dealt with these, and we've had policies and resolutions that we've committed to, so I think it's a pretty straightforward process. All right. No further remarks. Can we go on with the vote? Any objections? All those in favor of adopting the resolution will vote aye. Aye. All those in favor of adopting the resolution will vote aye. Aye. All those opposed? All opposed? All opposed? All opposed? All opposed? All opposed? All opposed? All opposed? All opposed? All opposed? All opposed? All opposed? All opposed? All opposed? All opposed? All opposed?

Starting in about 15 minutes to continue with this policy work. And we would appreciate all the help we can get. And we'd prefer it now. Thank you very much.

Recommendation of the committee is that the resolution be adopted. We also have- Mr. Larkin? We also have Council Bill number 98205 which is the Seattle Building Code. The recommendation of committee is that the bill do pass as amended. Yes, Mr. President, I wonder if the chairman of the Planning, Urban Development Committee could refresh my memory on that legislation that one was do not pass and IM 21 took over something to do with CEPA and the Superintendent of Buildings. I guess something to do with the process. If you can't go ahead. Mr. Rivel? If it's CEPA it's more or less Mr. Rivel. This is Mr. Larkin, simply a technical amendment when probably a year and a half ago the Planning and Urban Development Committee and the Human Resources and Operations Committee in passing an ordinance that dealt with administrative appeals from the superintendent's decisions on building permit matters pursuant to a 1973 Charter amendment, we put in there an interim procedure for appeals from CEPA related decisions. Interim because we knew that we would be passing a CEPA ordinance within about six to nine months. In fact that happened in September of last year we adopted the CEPA ordinance. I'm not quite sure why because we asked it to be reviewed by everyone but when that ordinance was adopted they did not fully and accurately repeal the interim procedures and clearly replace them with the new procedures that everyone agreed to. So this is simply a technical amendment to reflect the decision that was already reached and it's simply a cleanup ordinance for something that we thought was done and was not done as clearly and accurately as it should have been. Yeah there is a very long billboard rider on it but I didn't think that that would concern you. Moved and seconded, the report of the committee be adopted. Any remarks? All those in favor say aye.

Resolution number two five four seven four authorizing the submission of an application to the federal government for a community development block grant for fiscal year 1977. Mr. Crovel. What does this signify? This signifies that we're completing the work or what? Are we getting ready for the next step or what? Just very briefly. What this does, we're on 474? Yes. We have gone over the block grant submittal for this year and we made a previous policy decision back in December or so saying that one, on the physical projects we're going to, there are several that we have committed third year block grant money to. The Green, North Greenwood, the Market, the International District, new neighborhoods, SEED and Road Painting I think are the ones. We're going to honor those commitments. That's indicated in here. We are going to hold to a 20% social services commitment which means that some small reduction in social services because our total number of dollars went down by about a million. And we are continuing those services which we have, those that are continued are programs that we have already had enforced in second year at least, maybe first year. They are paired back. I think the OPP did a good job of pairing back because they found places where there could be some substitute money coming along and it could be picked up here, picked up over there or there was a valid reason for pairing back. This leaves us with about two million in discretionary money this year. This has been put into two rather general categories. One, housing rehabilitation projects, just over a million dollars and two, physical development improvements, just under a million. We'll make the definitive decisions on that part of discretionary money in about the first of September with the CIP. That is to say all of the capital improvement money at one time. We'll be looking at the roads money, the park money, city lights, capital improvements and the discretionary block grant at that time. So this has to be submitted in mid-April to HUD. It does represent a firm go ahead on those physical projects which we committed to, a continuation where we can and the social services we already have underway and then this discretionary money and that decision is put off until September. All right. Thank you very much. All those in favor of adopting the resolution will vote aye. Aye. Excuse me. Mr. Deville. This is the 474. Yes. I'm sorry the dates are throwing me. This is not, it talks about fiscal year 77 and everything and that's why I'm, if you're talking about, you're talking about resolution 25474. Yep. Okay. Is this, this is not the one that's adopting all the work you all have been working on in the Planning and Urban Development Committee. And I guess what I ask you is a problem. Well, you've been doing so much in planning and urban development you're just going to have to be more specific than that, Mr. Deville. Well, like what you've been working on this morning and what I attended last week a couple of times and so forth. That was originally Committee of the Whole and was reduced last week to Planning and Urban Development. Well, there were two things mixed in there which made it hard to address and one is block grant policies and two is CIP policies. They're just policies in general for funding physical improvements. Depending on when you were in there we may or may not have been addressing this. We had to finish that which relates directly to block grant today. Almost, we have a federal deadline we're working against. There's also been some work which relates to policy vis-a-vis physical improvement expenditures in general. Okay, so this relates to money that's supposed to be applied for in April and coming up in the future? Yes. Okay, why does it speak to fiscal year 77 which began last October? Well, if I believe it would be fiscal year 78 if that's the case I could never... Well, the resolution's got about six places where it's wrong. Well, if say... Okay, well I'm not... Yes, ma'am, if you said fiscal year 77 which began in October of 76 it says here they're going to demonstrate by October 177 which is still fiscal year 77 until you get beyond October. Well, that's on that one thing but as I understand what they're supposed to be doing is adopting something that will relate to and allow us to apply for the fiscal year 78 or else I'm confused. That's why I'm confused. The fiscal year which begins July 1. No, it used to begin July now begins October. It's been slid. See, the government, the federal government has changed their budget year. Maybe there's some help coming here. The federal government's budget year has slipped. Yeah, we're spending... The word I'm getting here is we're spending federal year 77, fiscal year 77. So this resolution only relates to what we're doing with the fiscal year 77 money? The federal fiscal year. Yeah, which is October of 76 to October of 77. So this is not relating to all of the new stuff and so forth that takes place from October 77 to October 78. I think what's being said is that the projects will be taking place in that period of time but the money comes from one year back. We're operating a year behind the bench basically. Well, why don't you... You want to put this off and why don't you two read it and make sure that the year is correct and then we'll take it up later. Alright, we'll hold up the passage of this until the end of the calendar and by that time we hope that Mr. Rivel will be unconfused and the rest of us will probably be confused. Alright, next resolution. Resolution number 25477 establishing the policy planning agenda for 1977 and 1978. You got the resolution there. I trust there's no controversy on this one. No controversy. Mr. Rivel. No controversy, Mr. President. There were a couple of things left out that had been agreed to and some mistakes in terms of how the public safety and justice section was let out. I have passed out copies of that that has been run by Casey and the appropriate people in the Office of Policy Planning and no one has any objections to it. Is it in the resolution? No, what I wanted to request is as we've done previously on a number of occasions, basically what has to happen and we just didn't have time to do it, is that the last page of the attachment needs to be retyped to reflect that. There's no objection. We'll do that. After no objection, the resolution body will basically remain the same but we'll add the attachment. No, what you're doing is retyping the last page to reflect the public safety and want accurately. Alright, any objections to that? Mrs. Lamfear. No objections, just a question. Is this something that we, are these amendments that were reflected in our discussion of this and did pass the council but did not get put into? Alright, fine. And I trust you will see that that's down, Mr. Ville. All those in favor of adoption of the resolution will vote aye. Opposed, it's no. The resolution has been adopted and the chair will sign the same. Let the record show that Mr. Tim Hill is back minus one pint of blood. Or did you give a quote? It is not. I'm hoping it is. Alright, further resolutions? Third reading of bills. Item number one on your calendar, calendar bill number 98240 approving and confirming the assessment role for LID 6664.

The housing code. Building code it is. The building code that did come in, we will hold it for a week so that the members of the council will get a chance to glance over it and see what is in that voluminous thing that they would like to consider before we pass it. Alright. Mr. Cropper. It's not before us. Well, I don't know. It's been a long time coming.
